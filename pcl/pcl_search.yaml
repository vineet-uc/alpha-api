  title: PACER Search API's and Webhooks
  description: "<b>PACER Search API's and Webhooks are divided into 2 groups:</b>\n\n\t 1. Get PACER Search API's\n\n\t 2. Bulk Data Download Webhooks\n\n\t 3. Get Search Results\n <b>1. Get PACER Search API's:</b>\n* These API's can be used when you would like to have PCL results for a respective page <b>(Note: To paginate to page numbers greater than 1 you will have to request with your search criteria first which will result in the 1st page of the PCL search)</b> . For each page results you will be charged $0.10 on request of that page. \n\n\t<b>Example Use Case:</b> Imagine you have a webapp where you would like to show certain data of your client then you could request this API and get the results. \n\n <b>2. Bulk Data Download Webhooks:</b>\n* These API's come in use when you need a bulk of data with certain amount <b>(Note: The maximum amount one can set is upto $10)</b> set for a search criteria your going to request. A webhook is sent back with the cost incurred for the search and number of records found in the search. To get all the results we have a separate paginated API for which you need to submit the job_id returned in the API response of a search made. \n\n\t<b>Example Use Case:</b> Imagine your doing a research on a particular type of case or a participant from the case for which you would like to have a set of bulk data then this Webhook would be useful for you.\n\n <b>3. Get Search Results:</b>\n* Providing the Job ID and Page Number this API returns the PCL Search Results. To get the PCL Search results atleast 1 request has to be made to the above mentioned above API's or Webhhooks to get the corresponding Job ID for the search made. \n\n\t<b>Example Use Case:</b> \n\n\t1) For Get PACER Search API's users once you have received a Job ID, to get the results from the 2nd page onwards you need to call this api with corresponding Job ID. \n\n\t2. Webhook users need to use this API to get their search results with the corresponding Job ID and Page Number."
